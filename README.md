# BigBasket-Product-Recommendation-System

This repository contains a recommendation system project for BigBasket, developed using machine learning techniques. The system leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to provide personalized product recommendations based on user input and product descriptions. The project includes extensive data preprocessing, visualization, and cleaning to ensure high data quality and insightful analysis. The core functionality allows for dynamic, user-interactive recommendations, enhancing user experience by suggesting relevant products in real-time. Visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to present data distributions across various product categories.

1.Recommendation System Development:
Built a recommendation system for BigBasket using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend products based on user input and product descriptions.

2.Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Performed extensive data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data quality, including dropping null values and calculating the percentage of missing data.

3.Data Visualization:
Visualized the distribution of products across different categories, sub-categories, and types using Seaborn and Matplotlib to derive meaningful insights from the data.

4.Text Vectorization and Similarity Calculation:
Converted product descriptions into TF-IDF vectors and calculated cosine similarity to identify and rank similar products, enabling personalized recommendations.

5.User-Interactive Recommendations:
Developed a function to accept user input and recommend the top N most similar products, enhancing user engagement and providing dynamic, relevant product suggestions.
